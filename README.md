100 splendid ideas
===

## 1. [Spotify like news app](id:spotify-like-news-app)

How spotify pushes new and interesting stuff, we can push personal news to user every week or month

## 2. [Website that displays today's dumbest news vs smartest/insightful news](id:dumb-smart-news-website)

Nothing more to add

## 3. [Auto drums player](id:auto-drums-player)

An automatic drum player that uses Machine Learning (ML) to figure out human speech in real time and adjust the tempo accordingly. I think google came out with something like this recently..

## 4. [TV Ad muter](id:tv-ad-muter)

A device that listens (uses ML?) and figures out if audio is an advertisment and mutes the TV. I feel 90% of ads seem annoying because of the sound.

## 5. [Airport announcer](id:airport-announcer)

Airport AI announcer that outputs relevant flight/airport information/updates without a thick accent or a condescending tone.

## 6. [Artsy country maps](id:artsy-country-maps)

How famous painters would draw their countries maps like http://thegate.boardingarea.com/if-8-famous-artists-created-maps-of-the-cities-they-loved/

## 7. [Reddit troll bot](id:reddit-troll-bot)

Probably exists. But I want something that is a proper chat bot and irritating as hell.

## 8. [concert sound creater](id:concert-sound-creater)

ML AI to recreate deep concert piano/jazz AMSR from regular audio

## 9. [Aristocrat bot](id:aristocrat-bot)

Bot that spews out english gibberish that pheasents cannot comprehend in a thousand lifetimes. Inspired from https://www.reddit.com/r/medievalworldproblems/

## 10. [Netflix/Steaming service checker](id:netflix-checker)

Bot that checks netflix (and other streaming sites) for movies/shows. Epitome of lazyness.

## 11. [Yelp twitter bot](id:yelp-twitter-bot)

Bot to analyse yelp reviews for establishments and give a yes or a no on whether to visit

## 12. [Ultra precise component management system](id:precise-component)

An ultra precise inventory management system, for 1 billion different components. Auto tag pictures and ML for recorgnizing. Will be helpful in sorting trash.

## 13. [Twitch channel for politics](id:twitch-politics)

Enuf said.

## 14. [Logical English generator](id:logical-english)

Correct english to its logical extreme. E.g. "double you" instead of "us two" or "we". Inspired by https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17168713

## 15. [Versioning for essays](id:essay-versions)

Something like git but for writers. It would be awesome to see the constitution as it was edited.

100 splendid ideas
===

## 1. [Spotify like news app](id:spotify-like-news-app)

How spotify pushes new and interesting stuff, we can push personal news to user every week or month

## 2. [Website that displays today's dumbest news vs smartest/insightful news](id:dumb-smart-news-website)

Nothing more to add

## 3. [Auto drums player](id:auto-drums-player)

An automatic drum player that uses Machine Learning (ML) to figure out human speech in real time and adjust the tempo accordingly. I think google came out with something like this recently..

## 4. [TV Ad muter](id:tv-ad-muter)

A device that listens (uses ML?) and figures out if audio is an advertisment and mutes the TV. I feel 90% of ads seem annoying because of the sound.

## 5. [Airport announcer](id:airport-announcer)

Airport AI announcer that outputs relevant flight/airport information/updates without a thick accent or a condescending tone.
